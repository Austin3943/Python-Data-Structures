# Python-Learning-2025

Welcome to my programming journey! This repository will document my Python learning journey throughout the year 2025 and beyond. My goal is a career in AI/ML and data science. It will include assignments from "Python for everybody specialization" which includes 5 different courses offered from Coursera online. Also it will include future projects in data analysis and machine learning. 

# About me
I'm a beginner learning Python step by step. This repo helps me stay organized and track my progress.

# Folders
- **Assignments/**: My Python assignment files from the Coursera courses.
- **Additional Projects/**: Optional projects or scripts outside main assignments.
- **Data/**: Data files used in my scripts.
- **Outputs/**: Output files like images.
- **NewCourseAssignments/**: Assignments for my new course will go here.


- **Lesson 1: extract_number.py** - Extracts numbers from a string using loops.
- **Assignment 7.1: assignment7_1.py** - Reads a file (mbox-short.txt) and prints lines in uppercase.
- **Assignment 7.2: assignment 7_2.py** - Prompts for a file name, reads the file, and extracts floating-point numbers from lines starting with "X-DSPAM-Confidence:", and computes their average.
- **Assignment 8.4: assignment 8_4.py** - Reads a file, collects unique words, sorts them, and prints the lists.
- **Assignment 8.5: assignment 8_5.py** - Counts lines starting with "From ", extracts the second word, and prints the total count.
- **Assignment 9.4: email_counter.py** - Counts email senders from mbox-short.txt and finds the most prolific committer using dictionaries.
- **Assignment 10.2: count_hours.py** - Reads through the 'mbox-short.txt' file, extracts the hour from each email's timestamp, and generates a sorted count of emails by hour. 
- **scalar_multiply_khan.py** - Performs scalar multiplication on a vector 'w = [1, 4]' with scalar '3' using 'numpy', then visualizes both vectors as arrows using 'matplotlib'. It includes a grid, axes, legend, and title for clarity.
- **word_analysis.py** - Counts word frequencies and groups by length using .get() from Chapter 9.
