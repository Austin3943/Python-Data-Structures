# Python-Learning-2025

Welcome to my programming journey! This repository will document my Python learning journey throughout the year 2025 and beyond. My goal is a career in AI/ML and data science. It will include assignments from the 'Python Data Structures' course offered by Coursera and will include future projects in data analysis and machine learning.

# About me
I'm a beginner programmer passionate about AI, machine learning, and data science. This repository tracks my progress as I learn Python and build projects to apply my skills.

# Python-Learning-2025
A collection of Python assignments from the Python Data Structures course (Coursera, Python for everybody Specialization).

- **Lesson 1: extract_number.py** - Extracts numbers from a string using loops.
- **Assignment 7.1: assignment7_1.py** - Reads a file (mbox-short.txt) and prints lines in uppercase.
- **Assignment 7.2: assignment 7_2.py** - Prompts for a file name, reads the file, and extracts floating-point numbers from lines starting with "X-DSPAM-Confidence:", and computes their average.
- **Assignment 8.4: assignment 8_4.py** - Reads a file, collects unique words, sorts them, and prints the lists.
- **Assignment 8.5: assignment 8_5.py** - Counts lines starting with "From ", extracts the second word, and prints the total count.

- # Additional Projects:
- These are standalone projects that apply Python to various topics, showcasing my growing skills.

- "scalar_multiply_khan.py" - Performs scalar multiplication on a vector 'w = [1, 4]' with scalar '3' using 'numpy', then visualizes both vectors as arrows using 'matplotlib'. It includes a grid, axes, legend, and title for clarity.
- "word_analysis.py" - Counts word frequencies and groups by length using .get() from Chapter 9.
