Welcome to my programming journey! This repository will document my Python learning journey throughout the year 2025 and beyond. My goal is a career in AI/ML and data science. It will include assignments from the 'Python Data Structures' course offered by Coursera and will include future projects in data analysis and machine learning.
# Python-Learning-2025
A collection of Python assignments from the Python Data Structures course (Coursera, Python for everybody Specialization).
- **Lesson 1: extract_number.py** - Extracts numbers from a string using loops.
- **Assignment 7.1: assignment7_1.py** - Reads a file (mbox-short.txt) and prints lines in uppercase.
- **Assignment 7.2: assignment 7_2.py** - Prompts for a file name, reads the file, and extracts floating-point numbers from lines starting with "X-DSPAM-Confidence:", and computes their average.
- **scalar_multiply_khan.py: scalar_multiply_khan.py** - Visualizes vector multiplication using 'numpy' and 'matplotlib', plotting a vector and its scalar multiple as arrows.
